# Boost Your Budget

## Project Proposal

This project aim to help users to deal with their personal finance in a user-friendly way.
The initial idea was to draft this project in an excel workbook, but I've decided to jump into Django so we could save
time and I would be able to train code skills.

My inspiration for it was the project from link below:

For sure that I would like to sell once it is done. But the way will be important and I am glad to bring it to my
portfolio.
