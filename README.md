# Boost Your Budget

## Project Proposal

This project aim to help users to deal with their personal finance in a user-friendly way.
The initial idea was to draft this project in an excel workbook, but I've decided to jump into Django so we could save time and I would be able to train code skills.

My inspiration for it was the project from link below:

For sure that I would like to sell once it is done. But the way will be important and I am glad to bring it to my portfolio.

### Tools and technologies
1. Python
2. Django
3. JavaScript
4. HTML
5. SQLite
6. ML

### Information

Users will be able to add expenses, incomes, savings and their categories. The website will consolidate everything and show a dashboard in the home page to help them visualize their spends and other financial items.

Once the database is populated with their financial data, a Machine Learning Model will analyze it and suggest ways to improve your finance management.

### Scope

The website will be built for everyone that wish to manage its finance in a user-friendly way.

### Costs

Probably there will be no costs on the initial steps and further ones will need time and analyzis.

### Sign-off
